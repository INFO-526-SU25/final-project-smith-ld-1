Features contain basic journal information such as the journal, article name, year of publication, and the racial makeup of the article.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 318 × 65\n       pmid doi         jabbrv journal  year month day   title abstract keywords\n      <dbl> <chr>       <chr>  <chr>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>    <chr>   \n 1 31764726 10.1097/AO… Obste… Obstet…  2020 04    03    Desi… To eval… Adult; …\n 2 31492539 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2019 11    05    Medi… To comp… Health …\n 3 30890269 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2019 07    05    Iden… Germlin… Adult; …\n 4 29605049 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2018 07    10    Expl… To eval… High vo…\n 5 28800945 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2018 07    10    Impa… Althoug… Age; Di…\n 6 27697287 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2017 05    29    The … Enrollm… Clinica…\n 7 27103178 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2017 05    01    Surg… To eval… Delayed…\n 8 28159409 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2017 05    25    Disp… To exam… Adenoca…\n 9 26706661 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2016 06    01    Dyin… To iden… Advance…\n10 26325527 10.1016/j.… Gynec… Gyneco…  2016 01    07    Asse… Sexual … Depress…\n# ℹ 308 more rows\n# ℹ 55 more variables: study_aim <chr>, study_location <chr>,\n#   study_year_start <dbl>, study_year_end <dbl>, study_type <chr>,\n#   data_source <chr>, race1 <chr>, race1_ss <dbl>, race2 <chr>,\n#   race2_ss <dbl>, race3 <chr>, race3_ss <dbl>, race4 <chr>, race4_ss <dbl>,\n#   race5 <chr>, race5_ss <dbl>, race6 <chr>, race6_ss <dbl>, race7 <chr>,\n#   race7_ss <dbl>, race8 <chr>, race8_ss <dbl>, eth1 <chr>, eth1_ss <dbl>, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nReference <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-02-25/readme.md>\n\n## Research Questions\n\nI provided two questions for review.\n\n1.  How have ethnic and racial inclusion into research changed across time?\n2.  How is the length of a study noticeable between different journals?\n\nThe overarching concept is to understand how trends could be seen over time.\n\n# Data analysis\n\nAfter review, cleansing was found to be the most intensive process.\n\n-   Many features were not needed (e.g., article name), as aggregation would be used.\n\n-   A challenging question was on designation of race stratification.\n\n    -   Race and ethnicity were not standardized across journal nor across article, making this challenging.\n\n# Data Cleansing\n\n## Overview\n\nCleansing used in these stages\n\n1.  Stratifying race/ethnicity\n2.  Pivoting the dataframe to be able to use for analysis\n3.  Aggregate values\n4.  Alter values to proportions rather than raw values\n\n## Stratifying Race and Ethnicity\n\nI manually reviewed mappings of values to ensure accuracy.\n\n-   Originally, automation via regex was considered, but not implemented due to risk of incorrect categorization.\n\n-   For values that I could not identify, instead of a risk of missclassification, I identified as a separate category.\n\n-   Values were stratified into: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Other (Unknown), White, and Uncategorizable.\n\n## Pivoting\n\nRows were designed as containing all values of race. This was pivoted to support visualization aggregation.\n\n| Journal   | race1 | race1ss | race2 | race2ss |\n|-----------|-------|---------|-------|---------|\n| Journal A | White | 10      | Asian | 3       |\n\n| Journal   | Race  | Race Count |\n|-----------|-------|------------|\n| Journal A | White | 10         |\n| Journal A | Asian | 3          |\n\n## Aggregation\n\nValues were aggregated across year and race to support a high level view of counts.\n\n| Journal | Year | Race  | Race Count |\n|---------|------|-------|------------|\n| A       | 2010 | White | 7          |\n| B       | 2011 | Asian | 5          |\n| B       | 2011 | Asian | 3          |\n\nInto\n\n| Year | Race  | Total Count |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| 2010 | White | 7           |\n| 2011 | Asian | 8           |\n\n## Proportions\n\nInstead of using raw values, proportions were assigned. This was more accurate to provide a better understanding as to how an increase or decrease in disparities were conducted.\n\n-   Example: if the number of publications increased over the years, by default we could expect the number of people involved in studies to increase\n\n# Research Questions\n\n## Racial & Ethnic Inclusion Over Time\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n1.
