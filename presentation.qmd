# Introduction

## Data and Purpose

-   TidyTuesday contains a repository of reproductive journals, each with values of the counts for racial and ethnic categories.

-   Data is taken from 2010-2023

-   With a background as a software engineer in the healthcare industry, I was interested to see how this data would change over time.

## Description of Data

Viewed below, the data is contained of 318 research articles, each with 61 features. Features contain basic journal information such as the journal, article name, year of publication, and the racial makeup of the article.

```{r}
#| label: show article tibble
tibble(articles)
```

## Research Questions

I provided two questions for review.

1.  How have ethnic and racial inclusion into research changed across time?
2.  How is the length of a study noticeable between different journals?

The overarching concept is to understand how trends could be seen over time.

# Data analysis

After review, cleansing was found to be the most intensive process.

-   Many features were not needed (e.g., article name), as aggregation would be used.

-   A challenging question was on designation of race stratification.

    -   Race and ethnicity were not standardized across journal nor across article, making this challenging.

# Data Cleansing

## Overview

Cleansing used in these stages

1.  Stratifying race/ethnicity
2.  Pivoting the dataframe to be able to use for analysis
3.  Aggregate values
4.  Alter values to proportions rather than raw values

## Stratifying Race and Ethnicity

I manually reviewed mappings of values to ensure accuracy.

-   Originally, automation via regex was considered, but not implemented due to risk of incorrect categorization.

-   For values that I could not identify, instead of a risk of missclassification, I identified as a separate category.

-   Values were stratified into: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Other (Unknown), White, and Uncategorizable.

## Pivoting

Rows were designed as containing all values of race. This was pivoted to support visualization aggregation.

| Journal   | race1 | race1ss | race2 | race2ss |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| Journal A | White | 10      | Asian | 3       |

| Journal   | Race  | Race Count |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Journal A | White | 10         |
| Journal A | Asian | 3          |

## Aggregation

Values were aggregated across year and race to support a high level view of counts.

| Journal | Year | Race  | Race Count |
|---------|------|-------|------------|
| A       | 2010 | White | 7          |
| B       | 2011 | Asian | 5          |
| B       | 2011 | Asian | 3          |

Into

| Year | Race  | Total Count |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2010 | White | 7           |
| 2011 | Asian | 8           |

## Proportions

Instead of using raw values, proportions were assigned. This was more accurate to provide a better understanding as to how an increase or decrease in disparities were conducted.

-   Example: if the number of publications increased over the years, by default we could expect the number of people involved in studies to increase

## Comparison of Study Length

2.  How is the length of a study noticeable between different journals?

-   Took 3 features, removed missing and filtered those without lengths

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: get and cleanse journal length data
article_lengths <- articles[c('study_year_start', 
                              'study_year_end', 
                              'journal')] |> 
  mutate(research_length = study_year_end - study_year_start) |>
  filter(!is.na(study_year_start) &
           study_year_start > 0 & study_year_end > 0 )
```

## Comparison of Study Length

```{r fig.width=8}

journal_labels <- c(
  "BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology"="BJOG",
  "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"="AJOG",
  "Fertility and sterility"="Fertility and sterility",
  "Gynecologic oncology"="Gynecologic oncology",
  "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)"="Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",
  "Obstetrics and gynecology"="Obstetrics and gynecology"
)

journal_labeller <- function(variable, value) {
  return (journal_labels[value])

}
#| label: plot article lengths
ggplot(article_lengths, aes(x=study_year_start, y=research_length, )) + 
  stat_density_2d(color="royalblue4") + 
  xlim(1990, 2026) + 
  ylim(-10, 20) + 
  facet_wrap(~journal, scales="free_x", labeller=journal_labeller) + 
  labs(x="Starting Study Year", y="Research Length",
       title="Comparison of study lengths across gynecological journals")
  
```

# Analysis

## Analysis

-   Comparison of race/ethnicity across time

    -   Not much change

    -   2020: highlight of 98% of values were listed as `Unknown`

-   Comparison of study length

    -   Journals seemed to have trends of lengths

        -   *Family and sterility* being less than 5

        -   *BJOG* around 10

    -   Human reproduction started in incremental years:

        -   2000, 2005, 2010
